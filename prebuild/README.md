Caution: Work in progress
-----

This will get you started on the build, but I didn't have time to figure out a way to accept the agreement automagically, so I finished the rest of the steps manually.

You could run some of the later steps such as setting up apache2 before initializing the quakejs server to automate this a bit more.

Once you have everything running, commit the container and use that as the base image in the main [Dockerfile](https://github.com/treyyoder/quakejs-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile)
